    "# II) Algorithm\n",
    "The following algorithm performs a distance based clustering on the polygons of each country in order to facilitate plotting. An iterative approach is applied, whereby in a first step the largest polygon of a country is chosen as so called *primary*. A buffer is applied around the primary and all polygons of the same country with their centroid within the buffer are selected and merged with the primary using unary_union, forming a new, larger primary. This step is repeated until there are no new polygons found to be merged. The primary is then saved in the list of country parts. Out of the remaining polygons of the country, the largest is again chosen as the new starting point and the whole process is repeated until no more polygons of the country are left. This procedure is performed on every country.\n",
    "### Ouput\n",
    "A list of geometry groups, of which each describes a single group generated by the algorithm. Each country therefore has 1 or several list entries belonging to it. Each list entry contains the following:\n",
    "- The country name and ISO signature it belongs to.\n",
    "- A polygon or multipolygon geometry.\n",
    "- A boolean indicating whether this entry is the main geometry, meaning it is the largest geometry group of the country.\n",
    "- The total number of geometry groups that the country consists of. This is an auxilliary information used in the following  annotation step to only process countries that consist of multiple geometry groups.\n",
    "- A name that corresponds to the polygon group. It is here assumed that the group with the largest area is the country. All other groups are labelled \"Unknown X\" with X being a numbering."
